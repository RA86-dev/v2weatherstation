Weather Station is a project designed by RA86-dev to create a unified workplace for the school to use. It is a self-hosted, beautiful server that uses Open-meteo or its self-hosted counterpart to generate data.
## To Add:
- Instead of pulling information from Open Meteo and then downloading it, if its self-hosted, please make it just fetch TO the Open Meteo server, to make it faster and make it automatically update. 
- The make update button should not be avaliable. Instead, it should automatically update the information using a week counter (604,800 seconds) and then runs ./item.sh which autodownloads the code.
